    <p class="pb-4">Welcome to Happ - the exclusive event management platform designed with your privacy in mind. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from you, how we use it, and how we uphold your rights in respect to this information. By using our app, you are agreeing to the terms outlined in this policy. Please read it carefully.</p>
  
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">
      When you sign in to Happ using third-party services, such as Google and Apple, your authentication is managed through Firebase. We collect and store your name, email address, and profile picture (if provided). This information, along with a unique user ID and an automatically assigned username, is securely stored on our servers. This data collection is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and Happ.<br><br>
      Happ allows you to create and manage exclusive, invitation-only events. For this purpose, we collect and store event-related details such as the event name, pictures, description, location, address, date, time, and the user relationships to the event (guests, hosts, and creator). This information is used to provide event details to guests and hosts, differentiate between guests and hosts, and facilitate event management.<br><br>
      When you accept an invitation to an event as a guest, you will receive a "Pass" containing your name, username, profile picture, and a unique QR code. This pass serves as a means of identification and verification at the event, allowing hosts to confirm your attendance.<br><br>

      The QR code on your pass is unique and encrypted, adding a layer of security to your data. Event hosts can scan this QR code to verify your attendance, but they are not able to decrypt it or access any additional information from it.<br><br>

      With your explicit consent, we may collect your location data. This data is used to facilitate finding a location for an event you are hosting.<br><br>
      Our 'Friend' feature enables you to add or remove friends. The related data, as well as invitations sent by your friends, will be visible in your feed. This feature is provided based on our legitimate interest in enhancing user experience.<br><br>
      Happ sends push notifications to keep you updated about various activities, including receiving an invitation, leaving a confirmed event, an event's cancellation, friend requests, updates to event details, acceptance of your invitations, and event reminders. These notifications are sent based on our legitimate interest in keeping you informed about your activities and updates on Happ.

    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Security</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">We use industry-standard encryption methods to protect your personal data and unique QR codes. Our servers are secured and monitored regularly to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data security.</p>
  
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">Your data is not sold or shared with any third-party services, except <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" class="text-blue-700">Firebase</a> which handles user authentication and push notifications. When transferring your data internationally, we comply with all data protection laws and ensure your data remains secure during these transfers through the use of standard contractual clauses.</p>
  
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
