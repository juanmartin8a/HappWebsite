    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">Welcome to Happ - the exclusive event platform designed with your privacy in mind. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from you, how we use it, the lawful basis of it, and how we uphold your rights in respect to this information. By using our app, you are agreeing to our <a href="https://www.happ.rsvp/legal/terms-of-use" target="_blank" class="text-blue-700">Terms of Use</a> and the terms outlined in this policy. Please read carefully.</p>
  
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">
      When you sign in to Happ using third-party services, such as Google and Apple, your authentication is managed through Firebase, a development platform owned by Google. We collect and store your name, email address, profile picture (if provided, otherwise one is assigned by us), and a unique identifier provided by Firebase. This information, along with an additional unique user identifier assigned by Happ for user identification within our systems, and an automatically assigned username, are securely stored on our servers. Additionally, with your consent, we collect and store a device identifier for the purpose of sending push notifications. You can learn more about how Firebase uses your information in <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" class="text-blue-700">Firebase's Privacy Policy</a>. The lawful basis for this processing is the performance of the contract between you and Happ, as it is necessary for us to provide you the services you have signed up for.<br><br>
      Happ allows you to create and manage exclusive, invitation-only events. For this purpose, we collect and store event-related details such as the event name, pictures, description, location, address, date, time, and the user relationships to the event (guests, hosts, creator, and invited but not confirmed users). This information is used to provide event details to guests and hosts, differentiate between guests and hosts, and facilitate event management. The lawful basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing a comprehensive and effective event management platform.<br><br>
      When you accept an invitation to an event as a guest, you will receive a "Pass" containing the event name, your name, username, profile picture, and a unique QR code. This pass primarily serves as a means of verification at the event, ensuring that you have been legitimately invited. The processing of this data is justified by our legitimate interest in ensuring the security and proper execution of events.<br><br>
      The QR code on your pass is unique and encrypted, adding a layer of security to your data. Event hosts can scan this QR code to verify your attendance, but they are not able to decrypt it or access any additional information from it.<br><br>
      With your explicit consent, we may collect your location data. This data is not saved on our servers unless the event's location data is your location and it is used to facilitate finding a location for an event. Additionally, when you choose to upload photos as part of the event details, we collect and store these images. The legal basis for this data collection is your consent.<br><br>
      Our "Friendship" feature allows you to establish relationships with other users on the platform. No additional personal data is collected through this feature beyond what is already outlined in this policy. The visibility of your existing personal data, such as your name, username, and profile picture, is standard across our platform and is visible to all users.<br><br>
      Happ sends push notifications to keep you updated about various activities, including receiving an invitation, leaving a confirmed event, an event's cancellation, friend requests, updates to event details, acceptance of your invitations, and event reminders. These notifications are facilitated by a device identifier, which we collect and store with your consent of receiving notifications. These notifications are sent based on our legitimate interest in keeping you informed about your activities and updates on Happ.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Data Breach Notification</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify affected users via email within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach. We will also take all necessary steps to minimize the impact of the breach and prevent future breaches.</p>
    
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Consent</h2>
    <p class="">
      Before you register for an account with Happ, you will be asked to check a box indicating that you have read, understood, and agree to our <a href="https://www.happ.rsvp/legal/terms-of-use" target="_blank" class="text-blue-700">Terms of Use</a>, which include this Privacy Policy. This explicit agreement represents your informed consent to our data collection and use practices.<br><br>

      During the use of Happ, we may ask for your consent to collect specific types of data. This includes:<br><br>
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc marker:text-black px-6">
      <li class="pb-1">Your location data to facilitate finding an event location. This data is not saved on our servers unless the event's location data is your location.</li>
      <li class="pb-1">Your device identifier for the purpose of sending you push notifications.</li>
      <li>Access to your device's photo gallery, if you choose to upload photos as part of the event details.<br><br></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="pb-4">
      You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent, you can do so by changing the relevant settings on your device or contacting us at happ@happ.rsvp.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">
      We retain your data for as long as necessary until you delete your account. Upon account deletion, all of your data is permanently deleted from our servers. This includes data directly associated with your user account such as your name, username, email address, profile picture, and unique identifiers.<br><br>
      However, please note that the deletion of the relationship between your account and any event, as well as the deletion of your device identifier, may be slightly delayed depending on the server's workload.<br><br>
      If you are the creator of an event and delete your account, the creator status will pass to another host if one exists. If there are no other hosts for the event, the event will be automatically cancelled and all information related to that event, including user relationships with the event (guests, hosts, creator, and invited but not confirmed users), will be deleted.<br><br>
      Additionally, when an event is deleted or 7 days after the event date has passed, all event information, including user relationships with the event (guests, hosts, creator, and invited but not confirmed users), is also permanently deleted.<br><br>
      Please be aware that these deletion processes are irreversible, and we do not maintain backups of user data after account deletion.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">User Rights</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. We will comply with valid requests to exercise your data subject rights in accordance with the applicable laws in your region. To exercise these rights, contact us at happ@happ.rsvp.</p>
  
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">
      We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at happ@happ.rsvp.<br><br>
      In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of consent in their country of residence outside the United States, we will delete that information. If you believe that a child under the age of consent in their country of residence has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's account.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Security</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">We utilize encryption methods specifically for the protection of your unique QR codes. Furthermore, all data within Happ is safeguarded as our servers are both secured and monitored regularly to preempt unauthorized access and maintain overall data security.</p>
  
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">Your data is not sold or shared with any third-party services, except Firebase which handles user authentication and push notifications. We use anonymized analytics data for improving our app and understanding user behavior within the app. Please note that your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, the United States where our servers are located. When transferring your data, we comply with applicable data protection laws and ensure your data remains secure during these transfers.</p>
  
    <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold pb-1">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
